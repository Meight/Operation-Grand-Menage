![A screenshot](screenshot.png)

This an action survival game, where you have to kill zombie in order to reach some area.
In this area you have to kill a number of zombie in order to clean the area.

## Features:
Before continuing you have to know that we had a lot of problem with the  Network Manager and some features are only available when you are playing Swayne. At the begening the game was multi player but due to some issue, we tried to make a solo game but due to networkmanger we are still facing some issue. So please if you wanna see every feature choose Swayne , but you can try Gaara's Ultimate if you want. Furthemore some bugs are still existing because we dont have time to fix it. Do not forget this game was a project for a course, tank you .

You just have to run OP_GM.exe
 
## Control
- Choose your character Swayne or Gaara 
- Use AZQSD Keys to moove your character
- Press I to open crafting system (work only with Swayne)
- To finish the game, pull some zombie in the main plaza where there is the Zombie tank and kill 20 zombie.
- To pick up item, left click close and aim the item you want to pick up ( if your character allow it)
- When you play Gaara, once you stacked 40 fureur you can use your ultimate by typing on R key 
- When you pickup ammo use key above letter to use it and get it.
- Whatchout when you pick up item it appaears in the inventory, do not use it otherwise you will " consume" your weapon .. We know this is not the best solution but we wanted something generic maybe too much
- Only Gatling require Ammo ! 
- Pick up yellow box and white sphere at the main plaza and then open your craft menu and create ne item !
- Some area will lock you for a time, then you will get a surprise , try it at the main plaza.



## Conclusion
There are a lot of bugs but as I explained we had to be quick to make a solo game " playable" for our course even if we started by scripting eveything using networkmanager because that was our first idea. But as a first game on Unity and in only 1 month developping we were not able to succes the multiplayer. But we get 4.3/4.3 so we are proud of our project even if it is more a prototype than a game.
